Overview

	The main objective is to refactor the code to loop through all the data at least one time. The purpose of the process is to calculate the volume and the return value for each stock of each year. Steve wanted to help his family by investing smarter. This is to collect information as we did in the examples and module 2. At the end of the refactoring, the result should be being able to determine whether your new VBA code ran faster or not. In the “Results” section you will be able to obtain those findings. 
	
Results

	The stock ENPH, also known as Enphase Energy, was a good example for this analysis. In 2017, the return was around 129%. In 2018, the return was around 82%. It was one of the two stocks that had a positive return in 2018. In both years, 2017 and 2018, the stock ENPH had a return of above 80%. Even though 2018 had more negative returns. Run also had a positive return in 2017 and 2018. RUN had a lower positive return in 2017 (5.5%) than 2018 (84%). 
	
Summary

Advantages 

	The biggest benefit is that the more comprehensible the code is, it facilitates maintenance and the extendibility of the software. It is also cheaper to modify because you are just simplifying the code and be able to get the same results. Users that are not familiar with your code can easily decipher what the code is trying to produce.
	
Disadvantages

	Coding can be difficult to understand if it is too long or big. This adds the risk of other coders not being able to comprehend what the code is trying to accomplish. If the code does not have proper test cases, the code can go wrong and cause issues with results. This in turn can cause confusion with another coder trying to modify or simplify it.
